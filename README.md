# Comprezz
Basic digital compressor under development using [iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2).
This project is not meant to provide a brand new compressor in the market, is just for learning purposes.

Requires code from https://github.com/danielsacco/DspLibs

# TODO GUI
- GUI Design
- Show input RMS against gain reduction and threshold
- Create Presets
- Stereo link


# TODO DSP
- Extract Compressor logic to a separate class so it can be reused
- In/SC level and Out level should be calculated outside the compressor so we can use separate ballistics.
- Stereo link
